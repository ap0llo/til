= .NET CLI environment variables to set on CI systems
:revdate: 2020-11-20

The following environment variables should be set to `1` on CI systems to disable features of the .NET CLI not required/desireable in a build environment:

- `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`: Disable telemetry
- `DOTNET_NOLOGO`: Do not show any logos
- `DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE`: Disbale the first run experience (the "Welcome to .NET" message on first run and preloading of NuGet packages)
