= Don't use `System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()`

== Problem

`System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()` generate a new temporary file in `%TEMP%` but in some circumstances throws an `IOException` with a message of _The file exists_.

That's because the API is just a wrapper around the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamea[`GetTempFileNameA` Windows API] which generates a random file name with 4 hex characters in it and fails if the file already exists (becoming more likely the more files exist in `%TEMP%`).
When there are more than 65536 files created be `GetTempFileName()`, the call will always fail until `%TEMP%` is cleaned.

Additionally, `GetTempFileNameA` iterates over the TEMP folder to check if the file exists which can cause unnecessary IO load.

This https://stackoverflow.com/a/50413126[answer on Stack Overflow] explains the issue in detail.

== Solution

Instead of using `System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()`, GUIDs can be used as temporary file names, because they are very unlikely to collide.
Using GUIDs also avoids iterating the TEMP folder.

[source,csharp]
----
using System.IO;

// DON'T
var tempPath = Path.GetTempFileName();

// INSTEAD DO
var tempPath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
