= Customize Output path when copying items
:revdate: 2020-12-11

When inlcuding items, the path with which they are shown in Visual Studio can be cusotmized by setting the `Link` metadata.

This will also change the output path if the item is selected to be copied to the output.

[source,xml]

...
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- Will be copied to the output as "file1.txt" -->
    <Content Include="file1.txt" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest" />

    <!-- Will be copied to the output as "some-dir/some-file.txt" -->
    <Content Include="file2.txt" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest">
        <Link>some-dir\some-file.txt</Link>
    </Content>

    <!-- Include multiple files and copy them to "some-dir"-->
    <Content Include="files/**/*.txt" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest">
        <Link>some-dir\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>
    </Content>

</ItemGroup>
