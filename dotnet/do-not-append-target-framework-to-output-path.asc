= Do not append TargetFramework to output path
:revdate: 2020-05-04

By default, SDK-style projects automatically append the target framework to the output path.
This makes sense for multi-targeted projects but might not be desirable for some projects.

To disable this behavior, set the property `AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath` to `false`

[source,xml]
----
<AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>false</AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>
