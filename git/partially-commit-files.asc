= Partially Commit Files

== Patch Commits

Git allows committing/staging only parts of modified files using a _Patch Commit_:

[source,sh]
----
git add --patch
----

This will enter interactive mode and allow you to select which parts of the file to stage.

== git-istage

Alternatively, you can use _git-istage_ as an alternative tool to interactively stage parts of files and commit them.

=== Installation

_git-istage_ is a .NET Core tool so it requires a installation of the .NET Core SDK.

To install it, run

[source,sh]
----
dotnet tool install --global git-istage 
----

=== Usage

[source,sh]
----
git istage
----

_git-istage_ offers keyboard shortcuts to selectively stage, unstage and revert individual lines as well as commiting and stashing changes.
For a list of shortcuts, see link:https://github.com/terrajobst/git-istage/blob/master/docs/about.md#keyboard-shortcuts[git-istage Documentation].
