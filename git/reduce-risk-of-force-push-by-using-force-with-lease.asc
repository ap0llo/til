= Reduce risk of force-push by using `--force-with-lease`

Using `git push --force` overwrites the remote repository possibly deleting commits that exist only on the remote.

The risk of deleting commits can be reduced by using `git push --force-with-lease`.

`--force-with-lease` will abort if the remote head commit is not the expected commit (e.g. the head of `master` on the remote is different from the local ref `origin/master`).
If the local and remote refs match, the push behaves the same as `git push --force`.
