= Use 3-way merge
:revdate: 2020-10-24

When git encounters a merge-conflict, by default , it only shows lines from the conflicting versions (the curent version of a line in the two branches being merged).
To also show the version of the line in the branches' common ancestor, enable git's 3-way merge.

[source,sh]
----
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
