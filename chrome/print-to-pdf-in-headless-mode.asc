= Print to PDF in headless mode

Google Chrome can print HTML pages to PDF without shoing the UI.

To print a pdf, run (Powershell)

[source,ps]
----
Start-Process `
    -FilePath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" `
    -ArgumentList `
        "--headless", `
        "--print-to-pdf=`"<DESTINATIONPATH>`"", `
        "<SOURCEURL>"
----

[TIP]
Because Chrome is a GUI application, starting the process through e.g. `Invoke-Expression` will not wait for Chrome to complete. However, this can be achieved using `Start-Process` with `-Wait`

By default, Chrome will include the date and source url in the header or footer.
To hide the header, use the `--print-to-pdf-no-header` commandline switch.


[NOTE]
The same command will also work in the (Chromium-based) version of Microsoft Edge (typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe`)
