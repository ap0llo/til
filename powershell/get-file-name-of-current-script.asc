= Get the name of the currently running script 

* To get the name of the current script file in a running script, use `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name`.
* To get the full file path, use `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path`
* **Note:** The behavior of `$MyInvocation.MyCommand` is different when used in a script or inside a function:
** When read in a function, `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name` returns the name of the function and `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` returns `$null`
