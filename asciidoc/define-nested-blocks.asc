= Define nested blocks
:revdate: 2020-10-24

To define a nested block in AsciiDoc, add an additional delimiter to surrounding blocks.
For example, to show AsciiDoc source code in an AsciiDoc code block, use

[source,asc]
------
This is a AsciiDoc code block:

[source,asc]
-----

[source,asc]
----
AssiiDoc content rendered as code block
----

-----

------

Which will be rendered like this:

'''

This is a AsciiDoc code block:

[source,asc]
-----

[source,asc]
----
AssiiDoc content rendered as code block
----

-----

'''
