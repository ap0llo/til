= Use a common output directory for multiple projects

Found on https://twitter.com/davkean/status/991651609443643392[Twitter].

To use the same output directory for multiple MSBuild projects:

. Set the property `UseCommonOutputDirectory` to `true` for all projects. 
  This will stop the projects from copying their dependencies to the output directory thus avoiding race conditions between projects copying the same files.  
+  
[source,xml]
----
<PropertyGroup>
    <UseCommonOutputDirectory>true</UseCommonOutputDirectory>
</PropertyGroup>
----
. Add a seprate project responsible for copying the dependencies. Set `UseCommonOutputDirectory` to `false` for this project
. Add a reference to the _Copy Project_ to all other projects to ensure all dependencies are copied when one of the actual projects is built
