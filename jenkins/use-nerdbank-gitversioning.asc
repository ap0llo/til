= Use Nerdbank.GitVersioning in a Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline

Nerdbank.GitVersioning has an option to not include the git commit id as semantic version prerelease tag when building a _Public Release_.
Typically, a _Public Release_ is a build of a certain branch (e.g. `master`), which is configured in the `version.json` file.

In order to determine then current branch, Nerdbank.GitVersioning reads the information from the local git working directory.
However, by default, Jenkins does *not* check out a local branch and the repository is in a _detached HEAD_ state.

To check out a branch and enable Nerdbank.GitVersioning to determine the build's branch, the `Check out to matching local branch` behavior has to be added to the Jenkins pipeline's Git settings.
